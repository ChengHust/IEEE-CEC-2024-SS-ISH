# WCCI 2024 Special Session on "Evolutionary Computation in Healthcare Industry"


## About WCCI
***
  World Congress on Computational Intelligence (WCCI) is the world's largest technical event on computational intelligence, featuring the three flagship conferences of the IEEE Computational Intelligence Society (CIS). 
  WCCI 2024 will be held in Yokohama, Japan. Yokohama is a city that inspires academic fusion and multidisciplinary & industrial association. 
  The Yokohama area boasts a number of universities, institutes and companies of advanced information technology, electronics, robotics, mobility, medicine and foods. 
  WCCI 2024 held in this area will strongly inspire the attendees to imagine next-generation science and technology as the fusion of AI, physiology and psychology as well as cooperation with intelligence-related industries.

## Aim & Scope
  Worldwide, the healthcare industry would continue to thrive and grow, due to the increasing demands of diagnosis, treatment, disease prevention, medicine, and service, which affect the mortal rates and life quality of human beings. 
  Two key issues of the modern healthcare industry are improving healthcare quality and reducing economic and human costs. 
  The problems in the healthcare industry can be formulated as scheduling, planning, predicting, and optimization problems, where evolutionary computation methods can play an important role. 
  Although evolutionary computation has been applied to scheduling and planning for trauma systems and pharmaceutical manufacturing, other problems in the healthcare industry, 
  such as decision-making in computer-aided diagnosis and predicting for disease prevention, have not been properly formulated for evolutionary computation techniques, and many evolutionary computation techniques are widely adopted in the healthcare community.

As an event organized by the Task Force on "__Intelligence Systems for Health__" in the Intelligent Systems Application Technical Committee, this special session aims to promote research on evolutionary computation methods and their applications to the healthcare industry.

The topics of this special session include but are not limited to 
  - Evolutionary computation in resource allocation for hospital location planning, aeromedical retrieval system planning, etc.
  - Application of evolutionary computation for job scheduling, such as ambulance scheduling, nurse scheduling, and job scheduling in medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturing, etc.
  - Multiple-criteria decision-making for computer-aided diagnosis using expert systems.
  - Web self-diagnostic system with the application of information retrieval and recommendation system.
  - Learning and optimization for vaccine selection and personalized/stratified medicine.
  - Data-driven surrogate-assisted evolutionary algorithms in pharmaceutical manufacturing processes.
  - Modeling and prediction in epidemic surveillance systems for disease prevention.
  - Route planning for disability robots.
